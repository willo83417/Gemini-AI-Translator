# Gemini AI Translator

This is a modern translation application powered by the Google Gemini API. It provides a clean, mobile-first user interface for fast and accurate text, voice, and image translation between multiple languages, and supports both online and offline modes.

## Design Features

### Core Translation Functionalityüí¨
- **Text Translation**: Supports real-time streaming translation, displaying the translation result immediately as you input text.
- **Speech Translation**:
  - **General Recording**: Converts the user's voice into text and fills in the input box.
  - **Real-time Speech Translation (AST)**: Directly translates the user's voice into the target language and displays it as text, achieving a more fluid conversation-style translation.
- **Image Translation**: Through the device camera or importing images from the album, the application can automatically detect and extract text from images and then translate it.

### Online and Offline Modesüåê
- **Online Mode**: Utilizes a powerful cloud AI model (Gemini or OpenAI) for high-quality translation. This mode requires network connection and valid API keys.
- **Offline Mode**: Translates using the Gemma model downloaded locally on the device (run through MediaPipe). Offline mode supports text, voice-to-text, and image text extraction.

### Multilingual Supportüåü
The application supports a variety of mainstream languages, including English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, etc., and provides "automatic detection" of the source language.

### Personalization Settingsüîí
- **API Keys and Model Management**: Users can input their own Gemini or OpenAI API keys and customize the model names they want to use.
- **Offline Model Download**: Provides an interface to download, manage, and delete local models for offline mode.
- **Offline Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Users can customize the voice, speed, and pitch of offline TTS for a personalized listening experience.
- **High Accuracy Japanese to Chinese Translation Mode**: For Japanese translation to Chinese scenarios, a special "two-step translation" mode (JP ‚Üí EN ‚Üí CN) is provided to enhance translation accuracy and fluency.

### History Recordüìä
Automatically saves the last 50 translation records for users to view and reuse at any time.

## Document Structureüèó

- `/` (root directory): Contains the entry point and main configuration files for the project, such as `index.html`, `index.tsx`, `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`.
- `/components`: Stores all React UI components. Each component is responsible for rendering and interacting with a portion of the UI.
  - `TranslationInput.tsx`: Source language input interface.
  - `TranslationOutput.tsx`: Target language output interface.
  - `SettingsModal.tsx`: Settings pop-up window.
  - `HistoryModal.tsx`: History record pop-up window.
  - `CameraView.tsx`: Camera translation interface.
- `/services`: Stores the application's core business logic, particularly for interacting with APIs and backend services.
  - `geminiService.ts`: Handles all communication with the Google Gemini API.
  - `openaiService.ts`: Handles all communication with the OpenAI API.
  - `offlineService.ts`: Manages the loading and execution of local MediaPipe models.
  - `downloadManager.ts`: Responsible for downloading, pausing, resuming, and deleting offline models.
- `/types.ts`: Defines the TypeScript types used throughout the application.
- `/constants.ts`: Stores application constants, such as supported language lists, offline model information, etc.
- `/i18n.ts`: i18next internationalization configuration file, manages multilingual interfaces.

## UI Feature Explanation

### Main Interface
The main interface is divided into two blocks, one for input and one for output.

- **Source Language Block (`TranslationInput`):**
  - **Text Input Area**: For inputting or pasting the text to be translated.
  - **Language Selector**: Select the source language, with automatic detection supported.
  - **Function Buttons**:
    - `Translate`: Execute the translation.
    - `Record`: Activate the microphone for voice input.
    - `Camera`: Open the camera for image translation.
    - `Settings`: Open the settings window.
  - **Status Display**: Displays the character count and current network connection status (online/offline).
  
- **Target Language Block (TranslationOutput)**:
  - **Translation Result Display**: Displays the translated text.
  - **Language Selector**: Select the target language.
  - **Function Buttons**:
    - **Swap Languages**: Quickly swap the source and target languages.
    - **Flip Screen**: Mirror the text in this block for easy display to someone across from you.
    - **Copy**: Copy the translation result to the clipboard.
    - **History**: Open the history window.
    - **Clear**: Clear the translation result.

  - **Text to Speech (TTS)**: Provides male and female voice (or custom voice) buttons to read the translation result aloud.

  - **Real-time Speech Translation (AST)**: When activated, it translates speech input into the target language.

### Pop-up windows
- **Settings (`SettingsModal`)**:
  - **Online Pages**: Set API keys, service providers (Gemini/OpenAI), and model names.
  - **Offline Pages**: Manage Hugging Face API keys, download/delete offline models, enable offline mode, and high-accuracy mode during the day.

- **History (`HistoryModal`)**: Displays a list of past translation records, which can be clicked to reload.

- **Camera (`CameraView`)**:
  - Provides a real-time preview of the camera.
  - Controls include: taking a photo, importing from the gallery, flash switch, and focus zoom.
